# FP1 - Proposal for Critique

## Interactive Art Installation

The basic idea of my final project is to create an interactive installation that uses p5.js and a face-tracking algorithm to challenge societal norms around slut-shaming. In this experience, words like "slut" cascade from the top of the screen, only to come to a halt when they touch the viewer's face, viewers are prompted to confront the damaging impact of derogatory language on women's self-expression and autonomy. The design will be interactive and engaging by allowing users to physically move their faces, directly interacting with the falling words. To ensure accessibility, I will use clear and semantic HTML tags, making the installation easier to navigate with screen readers. The message I want to convey through this art installation is to challenge societal norms and confront the issue of slut-shaming.

## Interactive Game Tetrics

The basic idea of my second project is to create an interactive rendition of the classic game Tetris, titled "Tetrics," offering a digital environment where users can engage with this iconic puzzle game. Players will interact with falling blocks, arranging them to complete lines and challenge their problem-solving skills. The design will be interactive by allowing players to control the blocks using keyboard input or touch controls, making the gameplay intuitive and responsive. To ensure accessibility, I will use clear and semantic HTML tags, allowing for compatibility with screen readers and assistive technologies. The core message of this project is to provide an enjoyable and accessible gaming experience that fosters entertainment and mental challenge.

## Personal Portfolio

The basic idea of my third project is to create a personal portfolio that showcases my self-introduction, HCI projects, internship experiences, and artistic work, including drawing and photography. The portfolio will be interactive by providing easy navigation through different sections, allowing visitors to explore each area of my work seamlessly. To ensure accessibility, I will use clear and semantic HTML tags, making the website navigable with screen readers and accessible to all users. The goal of this portfolio is to present a well-rounded view of my professional and creative journey, highlighting both my technical skills in UIUX and artistic expression.
